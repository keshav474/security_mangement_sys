Use Case: Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA) Implementation

Actors:
- User
- Administrator

Use Cases:
1. User Authentication:
   - The User provides credentials to log in.
   - The system verifies the user's credentials.
   - If the credentials are valid, the system grants access to the user.

2. Access Resource:
   - The User requests to access a specific resource.
   - The system checks the user's authorization level for the requested resource.
   - If the user is authorized, the system grants access to the resource.
   - If the user is not authorized, the system denies access and notifies the user.

3. Modify Resource:
   - The User requests to modify a specific resource.
   - The system checks the user's authorization level for the resource.
   - If the user is authorized to modify, the system allows the modification.
   - If the user is not authorized, the system denies the modification and notifies the user.

4. Administrator Access Control:
   - The Administrator manages user roles and permissions.
   - The Administrator can create, update, or delete user accounts.
   - The Administrator can assign or revoke authorization levels for resources.

5. Audit Logging:
   - The system keeps track of user actions and resource access.
   - The system logs details such as user ID, timestamp, and action performed.
   - Audit logs can be used for security analysis and investigations.

6. Security Incident Reporting:
   - Users or administrators can report suspected security incidents.
   - The system provides a mechanism to submit incident reports.
   - Reported incidents can be reviewed and investigated by the security team.

Relationships:
- The User actor is associated with Use Cases 1, 2, and 3.
- The Administrator actor is associated with Use Cases 4, 5, and 6.
