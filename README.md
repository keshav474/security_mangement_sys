In today's digital landscape, the banking sector faces significant challenges in maintaining robust data security and safeguarding sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII). One of the critical vulnerabilities that need to be addressed is Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA), which exposes unauthorized access to data and undermines the confidentiality of customer information.

The problem lies in the ineffective enforcement of proper authorization controls at the object level, allowing malicious actors to exploit vulnerabilities and gain unauthorized access to sensitive data. This poses severe risks, including identity theft, fraud, and compromised customer trust. Additionally, regulatory compliance requirements demand stringent protection of PII, further emphasizing the need for a comprehensive security solution.

To address these challenges, our project aims to develop an advanced cybersecurity system specifically tailored for the banking industry. By focusing on the two primary aspects of Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA) and Sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) security, we are committed to enhancing the overall data security posture of banking institutions.

Our solution entails the implementation of a multi-layered architecture comprising a secure authentication mechanism, robust API controllers, and secure access controls. By integrating industry best practices and cutting-edge technologies, we aim to establish a secure environment where only authorized users can access their data while ensuring the confidentiality of sensitive information.

Furthermore, our project emphasizes the significance of audit logging to enable comprehensive monitoring and traceability of system activities. This ensures that any unauthorized access attempts or suspicious activities can be promptly detected and addressed, bolstering the overall security framework.

By undertaking this project, we strive to fortify the banking sector's cybersecurity defenses, minimize the risk of data breaches, protect customer privacy, and maintain regulatory compliance. Our objective is to provide a comprehensive, scalable, and future-proof solution that empowers banks to safeguard sensitive data, instill customer confidence, and uphold the integrity of the financial ecosystem.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
